# Mesh Generation
[**Sorotoki**](https://bjcaasenbrood.github.io/SorotokiCode/) offers mesh generation for triangular and polygonal elements. The restricted domains for the meshes are given by so-called *signed distance functions* (SDF). The toolkit provides a set of geometeric shape (e.g., circles, rectangles, lines) and boolean operators (e.g., union, difference, intersect), allowing for a wide range of meshing domain.
