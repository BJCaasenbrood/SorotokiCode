# Mesh Generation
Sorotoki offers mesh generation for triangular and polygonal elements. The restricted domains for the meshes are given by so-called *signed distance functions* (SDF). The toolkit provides a set of geometeric shape (circles, rectangles, lines) and boolean operators (union, difference, intersect) such that a wide range of spatial domains can be reconstructed.
