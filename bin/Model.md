# Dynamic modeling 
[**Sorotoki**](https://bjcaasenbrood.github.io/SorotokiCode/) provides a finite element solver for linear and nonlinear (hyper-elasticity and geometric nonlinearity) problems. The *Fem.lib* works coherenly with the mesing libary *Mesh.lib*. The finite element toolkit offers a set of material models (e.g., Hookean, Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and Yeoh) that should allow for a wide modeling range of 'soft materials'. Furhtermore, the toolkit also provides some preset materials that are popular in soft robotics, such as Ecoflex0030 and Dragonskin.
