Due to its scientific diversity, it can be challenging for new researchers to quickly familiarize themselves with multiple scientific areas. With the aim to lower this threshold, Sorotoki aims to incorporate multiple layers of soft robotics research into one compact toolkit. Examples include: continuum mechanics, dynamic systems and control theory, topology optimization, computer graphics, and much more to come! The combination provides a highly flexible programming environment and will hopefully aid the development of novel soft robotic research. What can Sorotoki do? Sorotoki started out small, but at its current state, it contains a vast collection of functionalities -- tailored towards many aspects of soft robotics. Suppose, for example, you are inspired by the multi-gait soft crawler developed by Shepard et al. 1 -- see video . Can we model such a system easily? Well.... Short answer: no . As matter of fact, simplifying the (infinite-dimensional) dynamics of soft robots is no easy feat. It has been an active topic of research for the better part of the last two decades. Simulation of multi-gait crawling soft robot undergoing an undulating motion. The model is inspired by the work of Shepard et al. (2011). Original soft robot can be found here: Youtube video Simulation of multi-gait crawling soft robot undergoing an undulating motion. The model is inspired by the work of Shepard et al. (2011). Original soft robot can be found here: Youtube video Is it easy to code? Well, absolutely! List of functionalities To summarize, some of the functionalities included in the toolkit are listed below: Design: Implicit modeling using signed distance functions (SDFs), 2D-3D mesh generation, computational design using gradient-based optimization Modeling: Finite Element Models (FEM), high-efficiency reduced-order soft beam models (Lagrangian or port-Hamiltonian), easy programmable interconnections of a network of dynamical (soft robot) systems Control: Real-time (pneumatic) control platform using Raspberry Pi, vision-based sensing algorithms using Intel Realsense Depth camera Visualization: Fast and responsive 3D graphics rendering, mesh deformation modifiers (scaling, rotation, bending, twisting, mirroring), Forward Kinematic/Inverse Kinematic-rigging Accessibility: Minimal programming environment (i.e, focused on expressing complex problems with minimal lines of code). Open hardware: Four 3D-printable soft robots (e.g., soft hand, soft manipulator), and control interface). Short examples Example 1: PneuNet deformations A classic example in soft robotics is the PneuNet soft bending actuator. The PneuNet (pneumatic network) belongs to a class of soft actuators that, due to a geometrically induced stiffness differential, undergoes bending when pressurized. The geometry of the PneuNet is developed (and popularized) by Mosadegh et al. 3 , but historically it is much older 2 . To model the PneuNet actuator, lets consider the following numerical example. Assuming plane strain , we can simulate the nonlinear bending characteristics of the Pneunet actuator using the super-short code below (only 10 lines of code!): Code for simulation % generate mesh from image msh = Mesh ( 'Pneunet.png' , ... 'ElementSize' , 1 , ... 'BdBox' , [ 0 , 120 , 0 , 20 ]); % finite element solver (FEM) fem = Fem ( msh , 'Material' , NeoHookean ( 1.0 , 0.4 ), ... 'TimeStep' , 1e-2 ); % boundary conditions fem = fem . addGravity (); fem = fem . addPressure ( 'All' , 30 * kpa ); fem = fem . addConstraint ( 'Left' , [ 1 , 1 ]); % magic fem = fem . solve (); % take away message: simplicity > complexity Code for plotting Once a simulation is completed, there exist simple command to export the simulation as a .gif file. We can simple use the command below. This sets the frames-per-second (FPS), the axis for the replay video, and gif = true to make a gif file. fem . replay ( 'fps' , 60 , ... 'axis' ,[ - 33 , 120 - 86 21 ], ... 'gif' , true ) Example 2: Task-space controller for soft manipulator The next example shows the implementation of model-based controllers in Sorotoki. Consider a soft tentacle of length \\(L = 100\\) mm, radius \\(R = 5\\) mm, and a tapering of \\(75\\%\\) . We assume the tentacle is composed of DragonSkin10A silicone. \\[\\tau = J_v(q)^\\top\\left[k_p (X_d - X) - k_d \\dot{X}\\right] + \\nabla_q \\mathcal{V}\\] where \\(J_v(q) := \\lfloor J(q,L) \\rfloor_3\\) is the linear velocity part of the manipulator Jacobian matrix at the tip ( \\(\\sigma = L\\) ), \\(\\nabla_q \\mathcal{V}\\) is simply the gradient of the potential energy w.r.t to its states \\(q\\) , \\(X\\) and \\(X_d\\) the end-effector position and the desired position, respectively.
