[**Sorotoki**](https://bjcaasenbrood.github.io/SorotokiCode/) is an open-source MATLAB toolkit that includes an array of modeling and designing tools for soft robotics. This toolkit brings together various scientific disciplines within the field of soft robotics, including continuum mechanics, dynamical system- and control theory, shape- and topology optimization, computer graphics, and many more! 

# Installation
Download the latest stable version ([.zip](https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode/zipball/master) or [.tar](https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode/tarball/master)) and unpack the compressed folder at any desired work directory. To install the toolkit, simply run the command below. That's it, the soft robotics toolkit is now ready-to-use.
```matlab
% installation command
sorotoki();
```

# Getting started
The Matlab toolkit consists of a library of objected-oriented functions for modeling and developing soft robots. Each object-oriented function integrate seamlessly with one another and, to some extent, bridges the gaps between different scientific disciplines. For instance, *Mesh()* and *Fem()* provide numerical tools to deals with the continuum mechanical behavior of soft materials, whose extrapolated material models can be integrated into the dynamic model description with the class *Model()*. The main Classes of Sorotoki are shown below:

```matlab
% list of classes
msh = Mesh();	 % meshing class
fem = Fem();   	 % finite elements class
obj = Gmodel();  % graphics model class
mdl = Model();   % dynamical model class
```

To get started, type the following line in the command window:
```matlab
% installation command
sorotoki('demo');
```
