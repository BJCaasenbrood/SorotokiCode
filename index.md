# **SOROTOKI** - A soft robotics toolkit for MATLAB
[**Sorotoki**](https://bjcaasenbrood.github.io/SorotokiCode/) is an open-source MATLAB toolkit that includes an array of modeling and designing tools for soft robotics. Due to its scientific diversity, exploring the field of soft robotics can be significantly challenging. With the aim to bridge this multi-disciplinary gap, Sorotoki aims to incorporate several layers of scientific disciplines in one toolkit. Examples include: continuum mechanics, dynamic system- and control theory, topology optimization, computer graphics, and much more! 

## Quick installation
Download the latest stable version ([.zip](https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode/zipball/master) or [.tar](https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode/tarball/master)), and unpack the compressed folder at any desired directory. Alternatively, you can directly clone the repository with the command:
```git
git clone https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode.git
```

To install the toolkit, simply run the command below. That's it, the soft robotics toolkit is now ready-to-use.
```matlab
% installation command
sorotoki();
```
The command above is also used to update the toolkit. It is recommended to run 'sorotoki.m' to check for updates occasionally. 

### Citation
If you are using Sorotoki in your (academic) work, please consider citing the toolkit:
