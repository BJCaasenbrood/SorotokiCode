Sorotoki is an open-source toolkit for Soft Robotics. 

# Installation
Download the latest stable version ([.zip](https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode/zipball/master) or [.tar](https://github.com/williamhunter/topy/wiki/Help)) and unpack the compressed folder at your desired work directory. To install, simply execute the command below, and that's it, the toolkit is ready to use.
```matlab
% installation command
sorotoki
```

## Getting started
The main class of **ToPy** is 'Topology'. It defines the main constraints, grid and parameters of optimization -- but you don't really have to bother
yourself with this if you just want to get some results.
