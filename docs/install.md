# Installation
{: .no_toc }

Download the latest stable version ([.zip](https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode/zipball/master) or [.tar](https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode/tarball/master)), and unpack the compressed folder at any desired directory. Alternatively, you can directly clone the repository with the command:
```git
git clone https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode.git
```

To install the toolkit, simply run the command below. That's it, the soft robotics toolkit is now ready-to-use.
```matlab
% installation command
sorotoki();
```
The command above is also used to update the toolkit. It is recommended to run 'sorotoki.m' to check for updates occasionally.
