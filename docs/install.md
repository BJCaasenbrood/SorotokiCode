# Installation
{: .no_toc }

Download the latest stable version ([`.zip`](https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode/zipball/master) or [`.tar`](https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode/tarball/master)), and unpack the compressed folder at any desired directory. Alternatively, you can directly clone the repository with the command:

```rust
 git clone https://github.com/BJCaasenbrood/SorotokiCode.git
```

Setting up the toolkit is relatively straightforward. To set-up the toolkit, simply run the command below. That's it, the soft robotics toolkit is now ready-to-use. 
```rust
% installation command
sorotoki();
```
The command above is also used to update the toolkit. It is recommended to run `sorotoki.m` to check for updates occasionally. 

# Getting started
To get started, type the following line in the command window:
```rust
% show demos
sorotoki('demo');
```
